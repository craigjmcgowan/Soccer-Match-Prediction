## Various timelines of recent form - single measure
Using logistic regression, look at what timeline of recent goal scoring form best predicts game outcomes using leave-one-season out cross validation and evaluating models on percentage of matches accurately predicted.
```{r recent goals form}

sing_goals_result <- single_recent_model(prem_recent_goals) 

sing_goals_result %>%
  pander(split.cells = 15)

```

Taking into account additional games when determining recent form improves model results, which is unsurprising. Test and training set accuracy are very similar suggesting that the models are not overfitting the data and overall accuracy is moderate, suggesting that adding additional features to the model could result in improved model performance.
